        <h2>Relax anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <p>Prepare yourself for the Savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side  with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side  and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position  with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
